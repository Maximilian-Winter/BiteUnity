# BiteUnity

This is a simple example on how to use the Bite Programming Language in conjunction with the Unity Game Engine.
The Unity Integration is still in its early stage, so only the creation of a new GameObject and the movement of a existing one is implemented, as an Example.
This support also IL2CPP.
